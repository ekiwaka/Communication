# Communication

Usage

1. Load the solution (Test.sln) file to Visual Studio and build project. 
2. Executable is saved as Test.exe in the Debug folder.
3. Running the executable opens a command window. The server establishes sockets for itself and a client. 
4. Once the client is connected, data exchange can take place.
5. The project generates a single executable, so the messaging takes place in the same command window, 
   with the fox (server) and cat (client) alternatively messaging.
